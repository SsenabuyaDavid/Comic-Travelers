          <p class="card-text">The Moon, Earth's enduring companion, holds myriad secrets. It's the sole celestial body humans have treaded upon through the historic Apollo missions. Notably, the Moon's synchronous rotation always presents the same face, the "near side." Its barren surface bears vast impact craters, devoid of atmosphere, sound, or weather. Curiously, moonquakes occasionally jolt the lunar terrain. The Moon significantly influences Earth's tides and stabilizes our planet's axial tilt. Moonlight is merely reflected sunlight, casting an enchanting glow on moonlit nights. With its distinctive traits and historical importance, the Moon remains an endless source of fascination, igniting our curiosity and exploration.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Mars, the Red Planet, presents a host of captivating facts. Foremost, it harbors the solar system's tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, surpassing Mount Everest in grandeur. Mars features Valles Marineris, an expansive canyon system that could span the entire United States. In 2003, it had a close "opposition" with Earth, an event not seen in 60,000 years. Similar to Earth, Mars experiences changing seasons due to its axial tilt. Evidenced by ancient river valleys and lake beds, water once flowed on its surface. Despite its inhospitable carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, the prospect of future colonization fuels scientific interest and captivates space enthusiasts, making Mars a perennial focus of exploration.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Space exploration and zero gravity provide remarkable insights into the cosmos and the human body's adaptation to weightlessness. In the absence of gravity, traditional concepts of direction blur as objects float freely. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) adapt with unique lifestyles, consuming floating water blobs and rigorous exercise to combat muscle and bone loss. Unexpectedly, gravity's absence can lead to spinal elongation, making astronauts taller, while taste changes reduce food flavor. The breathtaking Earth view from orbit, with its curved horizon and delicate blue atmosphere, offers profound perspectives. These experiences deepen our cosmic understanding and underscore the human body's astonishing adaptability.</p>

It is renowned for its impressive storms, creating distinct bands of colorful clouds, with the Great Red Spot being the most famous, resembling a perpetual hurricane. Jupiter hosts over 70 moons, with Ganymede being larger than even the planet Mercury. Though devoid of a solid surface, Jupiter remains an intriguing celestial body for study, impossible to visit like Earth, yet captivating for its unique features and mysteries.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Saturn</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system, and it's quite impressive. 
            Unlike Earth, it doesn't have a solid surface; instead, it's predominantly composed of gases.
            One of the most striking features of Saturn is its stunning system of rings, which are made up of chunks of ice and rock. 
            These rings make Saturn look like a giant cosmic hula hoop!
            Saturn also has a multitude of moons, over 80 of them! One of its moons, called Titan, is particularly intriguing because it has a thick atmosphere and even lakes of liquid methane.
            Visiting Saturn would be quite challenging because it doesn't offer a solid landing surface, but studying it from afar reveals its beauty and mysteries.

          <p class="card-text">A World of Extremes Mercury, the fastest planet in our solar system, exhibits extreme temperatures, scorching during the day and freezing at night due to its minimal atmosphere. 
            Its surface is covered in craters, resembling the Moon's, and it has a peculiar slow rotation, taking about 59 Earth days for one complete turn. Mercury lacks moons or rings and is relatively small compared to Earth. 
            A Giant Scar Caloris Basin, the largest crater on Mercury, boasts a diameter of approximately 1,550 kilometers (960 miles) and is situated in the planet's northern hemisphere. 
            It formed from a massive impact event and serves as a fascinating feature that offers insights into Mercury's geological history, despite the planet's scorching temperatures. 
            Scientists continue to study this colossal impact basin to unravel the mysteries of Mercury's past. 
            The basin's unique geology includes intricate patterns of ridges and grooves known as tesserae, resembling a layer of peanut butter beneath a thin, strong chocolate layer on Venus.</p>

             Its retrograde rotation distinguishes it, earning titles like the "Evening Star" and "Morning Star" for its dazzling brightness. 
            This volcanic world showcases vast lava flows and imposing volcanoes but lacks water and is uninhabitable by known life forms.
            Notable Venusian features encompass the Sacajawea crater, a tribute to the Native American guide of Lewis and Clark, Diana, a deep canyon named after the Roman goddess of hunting, Pancake Domes with flat tops and steep sides formed by thick lava, and Tick Domes, distinctive volcanoes resembling their namesake. 
            The Tesserae Terrain exhibits intricate ridges and grooves resulting from extreme temperatures affecting rock behavior. 
            Venus, with its extreme conditions and compelling geology, remains an entrancing celestial body in our solar system.</p>

It boasts the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching up to 1,200 miles per hour, and its distinctive blue hue comes from its atmosphere's methane content. Neptune is home to the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm system akin to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, though it can vanish and reappear over time. The planet's moon Triton is one of the few in the solar system to have a retrograde orbit, suggesting it might be a captured object. Neptune is also known for its 13 known moons, including Triton and Nereid. Despite being over 2.7 billion miles away, Neptune continues to captivate astronomers with its mysteries.</p>

          <p class="card-text">The Kuiper Belt is located in the outer solar system, extending from about 30 astronomical units (AU) to 50 AU from the Sun. 
            One AU is the average distance between Earth and the Sun, approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
            It primarily consists of icy bodies, including frozen water, methane, ammonia, and other volatile compounds, along with small amounts of rock and metal.
            The Kuiper Belt is home to a vast number of small icy objects, including comets, asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects. 
            Several dwarf planets are located in the Kuiper Belt, including Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and others.
            Pluto was discovered in the Kuiper Belt in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh. 
            It was considered the ninth planet in our solar system until its reclassification.</p>
